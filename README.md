# Synth Example IOS

Warning (for teammates):
- This project utilizes an external library which hooks into the Unity system (in order to dynamically produce audio). The above project was compiled using an arm64-based CPU architecture, but should (hopefully) work on intel-based systems.

Also, the UI is not good (but this is more of a proof-of-concept).
